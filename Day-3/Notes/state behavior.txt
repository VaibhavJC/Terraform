1)

main.tf

one resource is created ec2 instance using ami and instance_type

resource "aws_instance" "ec2-1" {
	ami = "ami-12345679822"
	instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

- when we execute terraform plan for the 1st time:

will get information of what resources to create 

it will return 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy

- when we execute terraform apply plan for the first time:

aws inside create API will trigger and one instance will create.
here our working directory is refer to desire state and remote (aws) is current state.

now whatever resources we have mentioned in main.tf it will create in aws but it will take some default needful resources also which we have not mentioned in main.tf,
all those changes, created resources and configured files will be update in tfstate file.

so, when we execute terraform apply one .tfstate will file creates, which contain resource related details  


2)

resource "aws_instance" "name" {
  ami = "ami-00ca570c1b6d79f36"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  tags = {
    Name = "terra-ec2"
  }
}

now I have added one field here "tags" in main.tf,

my .tfstate inside these changes are not there and aws inside also tag name is not there for the created instance.

- now when we execute terraform plan:

will get: 1 to change, because existing resource block inside we updated one change which was previously not there.

- now when we apply 

.tfstate file will update with new changes, also aws inside tag name will update


3)
main.tf
resource "aws_instance" "name" {
  ami = "ami-00ca570c1b6d79f36"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

}

now, if I remove tag name from here and manually give tag name to instance in AWS

-terraform plan will return:
	
   no changes, as tag resource is not in main.tf, terraform will not rack the changes even if it is manually changed on aws.
